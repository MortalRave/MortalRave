## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm a passionate, self-taught developer and a Computer Science student in my second semester. Here, I share my journey of exploring new technologies, building projects, and growing my coding skills.

## About Me  🤔
I'm enthusiastic about programming and continuously learning on my own. I started with Python—exploring everything from simple automation tasks to more complex projects—and now I'm also diving into C# on my university courses. Recently, I've begun exploring mobile development with Flutter, eager to expand my toolkit even further.

When I'm not behind a screen, I work at a warehouse, managing documentations, coordinating deliveries, and communicating with suppliers. This experience has sharpened my organizational skills and taught me the value of teamwork and attention to detail.
